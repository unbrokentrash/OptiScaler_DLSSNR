    // resource already carries a subrect saying how big it is, so scaling by the resolution ratio on
    // top of that counts it twice -- vectors come out too long and the model warps its history past
    // where the surface went." Both cannot be right. If the model rescales from the MVec subrect to
    // its own raster itself, this factor is applied twice; if it does not, this factor is the only
    // thing making the vectors the right length.
    //
    // It is exactly 1.0 whenever the model is at 100%, which is why nothing has ever depended on
    // knowing the answer -- and it is not 1.0 at every other setting, which is where motion has been
    // reported as bad. Half-length vectors and doubled vectors both look like smearing during motion,
    // so the symptom does not distinguish them either.
    //
    // The reference implementation settles it, and against the factor. NVIDIA's own ReShade addon runs
    // the model on the UPSCALED colour with the game's live depth and motion vectors -- render
    // resolution, untouched. So on a 50% scale it routinely hands the model a colour raster twice the
    // size of its vectors and nothing goes wrong, which it can only manage by rescaling from the MVec
    // subrect to its own raster itself. A caller applying that ratio as well is applying it twice.
