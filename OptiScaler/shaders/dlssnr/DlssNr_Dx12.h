// The composition pass for Neural Rendering.
//
// Neural Rendering is two things, and only one of them is a shader. The model is an NGX feature --
// created and evaluated, not dispatched -- and that stays where it is. This is the other half: the
// pass that builds the tone-mapped proxy the model is shown, and then transfers the model's answer
// back onto the real frame.
//
// It is an ordinary compute shader with a constant struct, so it belongs here alongside RCAS and
// Output Scaling rather than owning a bespoke root signature and descriptor ring of its own.
//
// One shader, three modes, because all three read and write the same set of resources and differ
// only in what they compute:
//
//   Encode   the frame -> a tone-mapped proxy, plus an untouched copy to transfer against later
//   Down     the proxy -> a smaller proxy, when the model is asked to work below full resolution
//   Resolve  proxy + model answer + untouched copy -> the frame, edited

// Three dispatches are recorded per frame and several frames can be in flight at once, more so with
// frame generation. Each dispatch needs descriptors and constants the GPU is not still reading, so
// there has to be enough for three passes times the deepest pipeline we might sit behind.
// Descriptor and constant slots, consumed one per dispatch and reused round-robin with no fence.
//
// The pass records four dispatches per frame -- meter, encode, downsample, resolve -- so sixteen slots
// is four frames of coverage before a slot is rewritten. The comment this replaces said "three passes
// times the deepest pipeline we might sit behind", and the pass count has since grown to four while
// the ring did not.
//
// Four frames is not enough. Frame generation deliberately runs the GPU several frames behind the CPU,
// and the constants live in an UPLOAD heap written at record time -- so a wrap while the GPU is still
// reading a slot rewrites descriptors and constants underneath it.
//
// A fifth dispatch has since been added -- the calibration grid -- which at thirty-two slots would
// have left six frames, spending exactly the headroom the previous note set aside. Forty-eight
// restores eight frames at five dispatches. If a sixth is ever added, raise this with it rather than
// spending the margin again.
